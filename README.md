# PageRank-Approximation-Algorithm
Experimental evaluation of Monte Carlo approximation algorithms for PageRank - Eddy Frighetto UniPd Bachelor Thesis

Before running the algorithm:
1. Unzip the file "graph.zip"
2. Install the library "graph_walker" with the commands
   
  ```
   cd graph_walker
   python3 setup.py build
   pip install .
```
Then start the algorithm with the command

    python3 test.py
